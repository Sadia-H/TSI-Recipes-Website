    <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
        <li>In a medium mixing bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, and cocoa powder.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the oil, buttermilk, eggs, food coloring, vanilla extract, and vinegar.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until smooth and well combined.</li>
        <li>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Remove the cakes from the oven and allow them to cool in the pans for 10 minutes. Then, remove from the pans and cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
        <li>For the frosting, beat the butter and cream cheese together until smooth. Add the powdered sugar and vanilla extract, and beat until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Frost the cooled cakes as desired.</li>
